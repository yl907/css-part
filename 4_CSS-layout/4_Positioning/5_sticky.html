    <h1>Basic document flow</h1>

    <p>I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on new lines below me.</p>

    <p class="positioned">By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and our height is as tall as our child content. Our total width and height is our content + padding + border width/height.</p>

    <div id="containing">
        <p>this is first p in the containing block</p>
        <p id="contained">
            I'm relative to my nearest ancestor
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are separated by the width of one of our margins, not both.</p>

    <p>inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit on the same line as one another, and adjacent text nodes, if there is space on the same line. Overflowing inline elements <span>wrap onto a new line if possible â€” like this one containing text</span>, or just go on to a new line if not, much like this image will do: <img src="long.jpg" alt="a wide but short section of a photo of several fabrics"></p>
