"The viewport meta tag"

If you look at the HTML source of a responsive page, you will usually see the following <meta> tag in the <head> of the document.

HTML-----------------------------------------------------------------
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This viewport meta tag tells mobile browsers that they should set the width of the viewport to the device width, 
and scale the document to 100% of its intended size, which shows the document at the mobile-optimized size that you intended.

Why is this needed? Because mobile browsers tend to lie about their viewport width.

This meta tag exists because when smartphones first arrived, most sites were not mobile optimized. The mobile browser would, 
therefore, set the viewport width to 980 pixels, render the page at that width, and show the result as a zoomed-out version of the desktop layout. 
Users could zoom in and pan around the website to view the bits they were interested in, but it looked bad.

By setting width=device-width you are overriding a mobile device's default, like Apple's default width=980px, 
with the actual width of the device. Without it, your responsive design with breakpoints and media queries may not work as intended on mobile browsers. 
If you've got a narrow screen layout that kicks in at 480px viewport width or less, but the device is saying it is 980px wide, 
that user will not see your narrow screen layout.

So you should always include the viewport meta tag in the head of your documents.
